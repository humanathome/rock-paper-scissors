## The Odin Project: Rock Paper Scissors
Simple Javascript implementation of the [Rock-Paper-Scissors](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors) 
game from The Odin Project **Foundations** section.

This version of the game works with a UI, opposed to the initial version that worked only through browser console (see [releases](https://github.com/humanathome/rock-paper-scissors/releases)).

### Assignment
- In the UI, the player should be able to play the game by clicking on buttons.
- Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener to the buttons that call your `playRound` function with the correct `playerSelection` every time a button is clicked.
- Add a `div` for displaying results.
- Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.

Images for game buttons are taken from [Towardsdatascience](https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-rock-paper-scissors-ai-using-tensorflow-and-opencv-d5fc44fc8222).
